		<td>Button to stop expert and to close trades</td>
		<td>
			Manual intervention is not a bad suggestion and allows you to deal with market conditions but it is not something that
			can be readily demonstrated with the strategy tester. You can stop the expert by disabling auto trading or just removing
			the expert and you can manually close trades so I won't be writing any code for this suggestion
		</td>
		<td></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Trade with direction of different timeframe</td>
		<td>
			Given that the grid trader trades based on price movements I took this to man determine a direction trend using an
			alternate timeframe and only open new trades in that direction.
		</td>
		<td>1.0002</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Add take profit and stop loss</td>
		<td>
			The suggestion didn't go into more detail so I implemented this as a simple take profit and stop loss. The results are
			as expected but this might be starter code for you to build on the suggestion. Since the results can vary greatly
			depending on the inputs I haven't included the result in the table of results.
		</td>
		<td>1.0004</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Close all positions on hitting equity profit</td>
		<td>
			This suggestion is to wait until equity has increased by a specified amount, then close all open trades.
			This will reduce the total amount of trades held, and reduce swap paid, at the expense of lower profit
			but I haven't determined if the saving in swap will offset the reduced profit.
		</td>
		<td>1.0005</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Use range limits for buy and sell trades</td>
		<td>
			The suggestion has come in many forms and there are 3 sub types that I will cover as different versions.
			The first version uses manually entered upper and lower limits and is a good idea because it allows you to
			use any analysis techniques to adjust the limits but it cannot be backtested for a result. The second uses
			a trend type indicator to set dynamic upper and lower limits and the third uses oscillators to only trade
			if the oscillator is in certain ranges.
